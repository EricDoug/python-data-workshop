# Data-processing and Machine Learning with Python

Code and slides for a workshop I hosted at a small KTH machine learning group, showcasing Python and its useful data-processing/machine learning capabilities.

Execute the code, download [the pdf slides](https://github.com/halflings/python-data-workshop/blob/master/pydata_slides.pdf) and, *highly recommended*, have alook at the accompanying [IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/halflings/python-data-workshop/blob/master/data-workshop-notebook.ipynb).
